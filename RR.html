<h1>Raspoutine's Ramblings</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my blog site, I'll be posting some of my thoughts on here.
    I don't expect them to make sense at first, and many may be questions that are difficult to answer.
    Some posts might be controversial or difficult, but that is part of the fun.</h3>
    
    <h5>08/06</h5>
    <p>If you were to slowly become and a character from your favourite book or film, would you rather be a character that struggles through life having many difficult trials and traumatic events, or choose to live a somewhat sheltered and garunteed happy life?<br>
    And if so, why do we feel a sense of shame in choosing for things to be easy or happy, as though people generally don't feel they should be allowed to be happy? <br> Does the meaning we get from overcoming difficulty really outweigh the pain?
        And then which character would you pick and why?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>It's a tragedy that the universe is constantly killing old, wise people, and replacing them with children who know absolutely nothing.</p>

    <p>I'm going to create my own fashion style, that is part western/cowboy meets slav/gopnik.
        Think awesome boots and shirts, with tracksuit tops and vodka. <br>
    It will become the norm when Trump brings world peace.
    Affordable, comfortable and a clash of capitalism and communism.</p>

    If you need to label people to help you understand them, whilst pushing diversity then you are part of the problem you are trying to fix.
    Don't assume that because someone looks or acts a certain way, that they have the same thoughtsand ideas as the group you label them with.
